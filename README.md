# CHAOS lab ressources

This repository houses ressources developed by the CHAOS Lab. These ressources consist of templates, slides and small codes which relate to a large breadth of topics. Instead of creating one repository for each sub-topic, this larger repository is use to store these small projects and contributions that are meant to be shared publicly.
