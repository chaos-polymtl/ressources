  abstract   = {Approximately 75\% of the raw material and 50\% of the products in the chemical industry are granular materials. The discrete element method (DEM) provides detailed insights of phenomena at particle scale, and it is therefore often used for modeling granular materials. However, because DEM tracks the motion and contact of individual particles separately, its computational cost increases nonlinearly O(np log(np)) – O(n2p) (depending on the algorithm) with the number of particles (np). In this article, we introduce a new open-source parallel DEM software with load balancing: Lethe-DEM. Lethe-DEM, a module of Lethe, consists of solvers for two-dimensional and three-dimensional DEM simulations. Load balancing allows LetheDEM to signiﬁcantly increase the parallel efﬁciency by ≈ 25–70\% depending on the granular simulation. We explain the fundamental modules of Lethe-DEM, its software architecture, and the governing equations. Furthermore, we verify LetheDEM with several tests including analytical solutions and comparison with other software. Comparisons with experiments in a ﬂat-bottomed silo, wedge-shaped silo, and rotating drum validate Lethe-DEM. We investigate the strong and weak scaling of Lethe-DEM with 1 ≤ nc ≤ 192 and 32 ≤ nc ≤ 320 processes, respectively, with and without load balancing. The strongscaling analysis is performed on the wedge-shaped silo and rotating drum simulations, while for the weak-scaling analysis, we use a dam-break simulation. The best scalability of Lethe-DEM is obtained in the range of 5000 ≤ np/nc ≤ 15,000. Finally, we demonstrate that large-scale simulations can be carried out with Lethe-DEM using the simulation of a three-dimensional cylindrical silo with np = 4.3 × 106 on 320 cores.},

  abstract   = {CFD-DEM combines computational fluid dynamics (CFD), which solves the equation of motion of gas or liquids, with the discrete element method (DEM), a simulation technique based on a Lagrangian description of particle motion that predicts the flow of granular matter and powders. Resolved CFD-DEM solves the fluid motion with CFD at a scale smaller than the particle diameter (dp), assuming no-slip on the particle surface to couple the phases. The fluid solver scale is coarser than dp in unresolved CFD-DEM and virtual mass, drag, and other solid-fluid forces couple the phases. Resolved CFD-DEM is more accurate, but is orders of magnitude more computationally intensive. Unresolved CFD-DEM predicts solid distribution, pressure loss, mass flow rate, and dense and dilute phase flow patterns when the solid to fluid and fluid to solid coupling between the fluid phase and the solid phase are non-trivial. Researchers apply CFD-DEM to predict gas-fluid dynamics of fluidized beds, spouted beds, hoppers, cyclones, costal erosion, and rock slides. Open source codes, commercial software, and parallel computer architectures have accelerated its adoption in pharmaceutical, agro-industrial, and reactor design. Current research targets improving the solid-fluid coupling strategies and multiphysics problems including heat transfer, mass transfer, and chemical reactions within or at the surface of the particles. The field has grown to over 200 indexed articles per year (Web of Science) in 2018. This article is part of a special series dedicated to experimental methods in chemical engineering that reviews the most important concepts, applications, and limitations of each technique.},

  abstract   = {Models for particle-particle heat transfer are essential in DEM of thermal processes. A recently proposed model that easily calculates particle-particle heat transfer coefficients from effective packed bed thermal conductivity has for the first time been implemented in DEM for the thermal equilibration of particles with initially different temperatures in a rotating flat 2D drum and in a stirred 3D mixer. Experiments have been performed with low thermal conductivity polyoxymethylene and highly thermal conducting aluminum spheres. Comparisons show that it is mandatory to consider heat conduction in both involved phases, particles and gas, when the particle thermal conductivity is low. Derivation of particle-particle heat transfer from bed conductivity works well for both particle types, which is also true for classical, more complicated mixed conduction models. Contrary, the often used model of Batchelor for conduction only through the contact area between particles fails to describe heat transfer at low particle thermal conductivity.},

  abstract = {For a single isolated particle, the effect of overlap displacement on conduction and the effect of particle diameter/ﬂuid velocity on convection are comprehensively studied using a CFD-DEM method coupled with heat exchange. Moreover, the model is further validated in a pseudo-2D bubbling ﬂuidized bed and the inﬂuence of operating parameters (i.e., ﬂuid velocity, particle diameter, and mass loading) on heat transfer contribution is deeply revealed. The results show that the ﬂuid velocity and particle diameter have a more remarkable inﬂuence on convective heat transfer than conductive heat transfer. Besides, the particle-ﬂuid convection dominates the heat transfer while the particle-particle conduction is almost negligible. The particle-ﬂuid-particle conduction occupies about 10\% of the total heat transfer. Finally, the model is successfully applied in a circulating ﬂuidized bed. The average mass fractions of solid materials in the riser, cyclone, and dipleg are 0.737, 0.023, and 0.240, respectively. Solid internal circulations and lower solid velocities in the horizontal part of dipleg lead to a two-peak histogram distribution of particles temperature in the riser and the system.},

  abstract = {Heat transfer in granular ﬂows plays an important role in particulate material processing such as food production, pharmaceuticals and biorenewable energy production. Better understanding of the thermodynamics in granular ﬂows is essential for equipment design and product quality control. In this research, a particle-scale heat transfer model was developed within the frame of traditional Discrete Element Method (DEM), which considers both conductive heat transfer and radiative heat transfer among particles. A particle-wall heat transfer model was also proposed for resolving particle-wall conductive and radiative heat transfer. The developed thermal DEM model was validated by modeling heat transfer in packed beds and comparing simulation predictions with experimental measurements. The thermal DEM model was successfully applied to the simulation of heat transfer in binary component granular ﬂows in a double screw reactor designed for biomass fast pyrolysis to gain better understanding of the heat transfer in the system. The existence of both spatial and temporal temperature oscillations is observed in the double screw reactor. The effects of the operating conditions on the average temperature proﬁle, biomass particle temperature probability distribution, heat ﬂux and heat transfer coeﬃcient are analyzed. Results indicate that the particle-ﬂuid-particle conductive heat transfer pathways are the dominant contributors to the total heat ﬂux, which accounts for approximately 70\%–80\% in the total heat ﬂux. Radiative heat transfer contributes 14\%–26\% to the total heat ﬂux and the conductive heat transfer through contact surface takes only 1\%–5\% in the total heat ﬂux. The total heat transfer coeﬃcient in the double screw reactor is also reported, which varies from 70 to 110 W/(m2 • K) depending on the operating conditions.},

The proposed thermal model simulates the particles using the discrete element method, generating a particle distribution inside the packed bed. It considers direct and indirect conduction, convection, and radiation and evaluates the local heat transfer phenomena. One of its main advantages is its flexibility to deliver results at the particle level, which provides detailed information than continuous models. A comparison with experimental data from the literature indicates good agreement, with mean absolute errors lower than 8 K. Finally, through a sensitivity analysis, it was demonstrated that the selection of an appropriate Nusselt number is essential because it is related to the convective heat transfer, which corresponds to 85.8\% of the total heat transfer during the charging process. For the standby process, particle fluid conduction is the predominant heat transfer mechanism, accounting for 27.5\% of the total heat transfer.},

The proposed method, based on a ﬁnite difference solution, is integrated into the Discrete Element Method (DEM) applicable to multi-particle systems accounting for the following heat transfer mechanisms: particle–particle, particle–wall, particle–ﬂuid–particle heat conduction, particle–particle radiation and particle–ﬂuid convection. For this purpose, boundary conditions of the second and third kind are formulated. Based on various veriﬁcations performed, the underlying sub-approaches of the heat transfer model are validated against resolved FVM simulations performed with the commercial CFD-package ANSYS Fluent. This ﬁrstly includes cases with constant heat ﬂux and heat transfer coefﬁcient prescribed for a single particle which allows a basic systematic veriﬁcation of the implemented model. Secondly particle–particle radiation and particle–particle heat conduction are investigated. These cases are of greater complexity as the resolution of the used heat transfer model and the local heat transfer itself become important. In addition to the thorough model validation on the small scale, heat transfer within packed beds is addressed as large scale cases. To compare the implemented resolved inner particle heat transfer model with literature data, the effective thermal conductivity (ETC) is calculated for packings of thermally thin particles with various particle thermal conductivities. To underline the importance of a resolved 3D heat transfer model in the context of the DEM, material parameters are considered which are attributed to thermally thick particles, thereafter. Here the resolved heat transfer model is compared against the more commonly used unresolved model approach with one constant temperature value associated to a particle. Noticeable differences occur when evaluating heat ﬂuxes within the packing, the time to reach the steady state and for ETC-values obtained. The performed investigations lay the foundation to include the derived resolved DEM inner particle heat transfer model as part of a coupled DEM–CFD framework.},

The proposed method is integrated in an existing Computational Fluid Dynamics/Discrete Element Method (CFD/DEM) framework where the particle-wall contact heat conduction is solved through the DEM and set as a source term to the CFD. The 3D temperature proﬁle within the wall is solved in time and space in the CFD. The newly calculated wall temperatures are coupled back to the DEM to elaborate the new particle-wall heat ﬂuxes. Two simulation cases are considered. Firstly, a simple rotating drum is simulated to underline the relevance of the realized wall heat transfer model. The focus is set on the calculation of the temperature evolution of the wall. Therefore, only particle-particle and particle-wall heat transfer mechanisms are considered. We use the material aluminum for both, particles and walls and choose the wall dimensions so that the wall mass is approximately one third of the total particle mass. In addition to that, the particle diameter is set to 8 mm which allows the usage of the lumped capacity approach (spatially constant particle temperature) for solving the particle temperature over time. To validate the particle-wall heat transfer, we compare CFD/DEM simulations involving the materials aluminum and polyoxymethylene (POM) with performed experiments in the second part of our investigation. The following heat transfer mechanisms are accounted for: particle-particle, particle-wall heat conduction, resolved particle and wall inner heat conduction and convection. For the determination of the local heat transfer coefﬁcient of a particle, a distribution function is used. The convective heat transfer between ﬂuid and walls is calculated in the CFD. Particle surface temperatures are compared with measurements of an infrared camera. To show the inﬂuence of the particle-wall heat transfer two simulation cases with and without particle-wall heat transfer are performed. The numerical results are in a good agreement with the experiments in case of POM. For the material aluminum where the inﬂuence of the particle-wall heat transfer is more pronounced due to a higher thermal conductivity only the model with wall heat transfer ﬁts the experimental results well.},

  abstract   = {Particle thermal radiation plays a signiﬁcant role in many heat transport devices, such as pebble-bed high temperature gas-cooled nuclear reactors (HTGR). The effect of particle thermal radiation in packed pebble beds has been rarely investigated at particle scale. In this work, a complete CFD-DEM method coupled with particle-scale radiation is discussed for packed pebble beds, considering particle motion, ﬂuid ﬂow, particle-ﬂuid interactions and heat convection, conduction and particle radiation. It is shown that, compared to the case without particle radiation, heat transfer is enhanced greatly by particle radiation at high temperatures. A particle radiation factor (PRF) is proposed as an independent non-dimensional parameter to qualify the effect of particle-scale radiation in packed pebble beds. The PRF increases signiﬁcantly with temperature and decreases gradually as the heat storage capacity or the thermal conductivity of the ﬂuid increases. A demonstrative utilization of the present model is performed for a benchmark problem based on the HTR-10 nuclear reactor, and the results in general are in agreement with the results predicted by other empirical codes. When the nuclear reactor is above full power, the power required by the fan will increase signiﬁcantly. In the decay heat removal process, particle radiation is essential to keep the bed temperature below the allowable limit, which is signiﬁcant for nuclear reactor safety.},

In this work, CFD–DEM approach is adopted to investigate the heat transfer behaviour in a moving bed which is relevant to the raceway region in an ironmaking blast furnace. The solid ﬂow behaviour including ﬂow pattern, velocity, and microscopic properties are investigated. A good agreement of gas temperature distribution between simulation and experiments is achieved. Then the heat transfer behaviour is analysed quantitatively through heat ﬂux and contribution of each heat transfer mode. It reveals that under the conditions considered in this work, particle-ﬂuid convection is dominant, and the contribution of radiation is very small but increases when the bed temperature is high. Solid ﬂow rate and gas ﬂow rate have signiﬁcant but different inﬂuences on the momentum and thermal behaviour in moving beds. The study presented in this work provides a solid base for the further investigation of thermal behaviour in moving beds with the consideration of chemical reactions, and more complicated operational conditions.},
