	abstract = {In powder bed additive manufacturing (3D printing), powder spreading plays a dominant role in determining not only the subsequent process but also the quality/performance of the printed part. Therefore, how to realize a superior powder bed with desired structure and property is of key significance and has been the main concern for researchers and engineers, which needs more in-depth insights and understanding. In this article, the spreading process of 316 L stainless steel powder with continuous size distribution in practical SLM 3D printing was numerically reproduced by discrete element method. The effects of processing parameters on the macro- and microscopic properties of the spread powder beds were systematically investigated. Corresponding dynamics and mechanisms were analyzed. The results show that through comprehensive analyses, the optimal blade velocity and gap height of 0.01 m/s and 3 D (D90) are preferred for the superior powder bed with high packing density and good uniformity. The increasing particle flow instability and motion inertia caused by the high blade velocity as well as the serious wall effect and high jamming probability caused by the low gap height are the main reasons for the decline of the powder bed quality.},

	abstract = {The quality of powder layers, speciﬁcally their packing density and surface uniformity, is a critical factor inﬂuencing the quality of components produced by powder bed metal additive manufacturing (AM) processes, including selective laser melting, electron beam melting and binder jetting. The present work employs a computational model to study the critical inﬂuence of powder cohesiveness on the powder recoating process in AM. The model is based on the discrete element method (DEM) with particle-to-particle and particle-to-wall interactions involving frictional contact, rolling resistance and cohesive forces. Quantitative metrics, namely the spatial mean values and standard deviations of the packing fraction and surface proﬁle ﬁeld, are deﬁned in order to evaluate powder layer quality. Based on these metrics, the size-dependent behavior of exemplary plasma-atomized Ti-6Al-4V powders during the recoating process is studied. It is found that decreased particle size / increased cohesiveness leads to considerably decreased powder layer quality in terms of low, strongly varying packing fractions and highly non-uniform surface proﬁles. For relatively ﬁne-grained powders (mean particle diameter 17µm), it is shown that cohesive forces dominate gravity forces by two orders of magnitude leading to low quality powder layers not suitable for subsequent laser melting without additional layer / surface ﬁnishing steps. Besides particle-to-particle adhesion, this contribution quantiﬁes the inﬂuence of mechanical bulk powder material parameters, nominal layer thickness, blade velocity as well as particleto-wall adhesion. Finally, the implications of the resulting powder layer characteristics on the subsequent melting process are discussed and practical recommendations are given for the choice of powder recoating process parameters. While the present study focuses on a rigid blade recoating mechanism, the proposed simulation framework can be applied to and the general results can be transferred to systems based on alternative recoating tools such as soft blades, rakes or rotating rollers.},

	abstract = {The cohesive interactions between ﬁne metal powder particles crucially inﬂuence their ﬂow behavior, which is important to many powder-based manufacturing processes including metal additive manufacturing (AM). The present work proposes a novel modeling and characterization approach for micron-scale metal powders, with a focus on characteristics of importance to powder bed AM. The model is based on the discrete element method (DEM), and the considered particle-to-particle and particle-to-wall interactions involve frictional contact, rolling resistance and cohesive forces. Special emphasis lies on the modeling of cohesion. The proposed adhesion force law is deﬁned by the pull-off force resulting from the surface energy of powder particles in combination with a van-der-Waals force curve regularization. The model is applied to predict the angle of repose (AOR) of exemplary spherical Ti-6Al-4 V powders, and the surface energy value underlying the adhesion force law is calibrated by ﬁtting the corresponding angle of repose values from numerical and experimental funnel tests. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the ﬁrst work providing an experimental estimate for the effective surface energy of the considered class of metal powders. By this approach, an effective surface energy of 0.1mJ/m2 is found for the investigated Ti-6Al-4 V powder. This value is considerably lower than typical experimental values for ﬂat metal contact surfaces, which range from 30 − 50mJ/m2. Thus, factors such as surface roughness, surface chemistry and potential surface oxidation have crucial inﬂuence on bulk power behavior. Moreover, the present study demonstrates that a neglect of the related cohesive forces leads to a drastical underestimation of the AOR and, consequently, to an insufﬁcient representation of the bulk powder behavior.},
